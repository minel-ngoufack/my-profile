			<h2>Dancing</h2>
			<p class="text-justify">
				I have always loved dancing. Since I have more time this year, I decided to take courses in order to really learn. I am learning Hip-hop jazz, Ragga Dancehall and twerk. It gives me more self-confidence and I have made a lot of new friends.

			<h2>Reading</h2>
			<p class="text-justify">
				I am fond of reading, books have taught me so much! When I was younger, I used to read sci-fi (Harry Potter, Hunger Games...) and real life books (The Princess Diaries,Devil wears Prada). As I grew up, I was more into psychology and self-development books. I'd like to read more books about research related to humans behaviors and organizations

			<h2>Blogging & Vlogging</h2>
			<p class="text-justify">
				I am talkative, I love chatting and you can notice it when I write and when I talk. I started writing when I was 9, first in my diary, then I wrote novels on a Facebook page when I was a teenager. Hence, blogging and vlogging are the best way for me to express this aspect of my personality.
